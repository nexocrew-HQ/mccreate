### Softwares

| Software   | Implemented |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Purpur     | ✅          |
| Paper      | ✅          |
| Velocity   | 🚧          |
| Waterfall  | 🚧          |
| Travertine | 🚧          |

_(✅ = added, 🚧 = will be added soon)_

#### Projects that wont be added soon:

- Fabric
- Forge
- Spigot

**Reason:** These project require the execution of an installer.jar file to get the server.jar file. This would require java on the users device, so the program would need to check if java is installed and if not, install it. This will maybe be added in the not so near future.
